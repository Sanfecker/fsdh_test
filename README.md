Test

## Getting Started

The data file contains mock data for the Graphs to display..

I organised it in the way i would have if i was getting that data from an API.

Clicking on the Create Budget button adds a budget to the Budget horizontal list on the first page.

Slide or Tap into the next page reveals a bar chart displaying mock data for 4 weeks of expenses in the different categories earlier specified.

Slide or Tap into the final page reveals a line graph displaying the total amount being spent in each category week after week from 0 expenses adding up to the final value.
also adding up to the total expense from the other categories and the top of the graph shows the total amount spent after the 4 week period.

UI Idea was gotten from PInterest.. Budgeting system idea gotten from the internet.. (The Envelope budgeting system).
